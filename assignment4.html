            <h1>Courtney McKee's Assignment 4!</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 4 which includes the circuit board, schematic, a code snippet. Sadly, The circuit operation is not present at the moment because the arduino broke.
            </p>
            <h1> Circuit </h1>
            <p>
            <img src="higherbre.jpg" width=600></a>
            <img src = "higherard.jpg" width = 600 </a>
            <img src = "higherwires.jpg" width = 500 </a>
            </p>
            <p> The breadboard is on the left which is connected to the arduino and the led strip The breadboard also had a photoresistor so that turned the lighting on the led strip to on or off. <br>
            The transistor is connected to pin 9 and the photoresistor is connected to pin A0. On the farthest right it is showing which wires are connected.
          <br> To see more information about the board layout look at the schematic.</p>
            <h1> Schematic </h1>
            <p> <img src="highercalc.jpg" width=600></a> </p>
            <p>This shows the calculations of ohms and which resistors I used. The equation I used was ohms law which is Voltage (volts) = current (Amperes) * Resistance (ohms). Short hand it is V(V) = I(A) * R(ohms)
            <br> For the first calculation I used 5V because this is the voltage coming from the controller board. I used 20mA for I because that is the desired current.
             I used a 10K resistor becasue it insures that there will not be a short and it limits the current. If I were also to change the resistor it would change the output voltages/ sensor readings. <br>
             For the second calculation I was finding how much current is running through the transistor. I found how many lights I was using and found the watts. Using this I found how much current is running through
             my transistor. As long as it is under.6A then I am not going over the max current. 
             For the last calculation I was finding what the minimum resistance for the transistor which is 11.9 but I used a 10K resistor to insure that there will not be a short and it limits the current.

            <p> This is the schematic which shows which pins, resistors and voltage that was used on the board.</p>
            <h1> Code Snippet </h1>
            <p> <img src="highervoltcode.png" height= 500 width=1000</a> </p>
            <p>This shows the code that I used to make the led strip turn on/off with the photoresistor </p>
            <h1> Circuit Operation </h1>
            <p>Sadly, my Arduino broke and there is no video to show for now.</p>
