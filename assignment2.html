            <h1>Courtney McKee's Assignment 2!</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2 which inlcudes the circuit board, schematic, a code snippet, and the circuit operation!!
            </p>
            <h1> Circuit </h1>
            <p>
            <img src="fadebr.jpg" width=800></a>
            <img src="fadear.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p> The image on the left is the breadboard which includes a button and three leds. The red led is conected to pin 5, green to pin 6, and yellow to pin 10. On the right is the arduino which shows that I used ground, 5V, and 4 pins (2,5,6,10).
            When the button is pressed on the board then the three lights brighten and then fade in in order of red, green, and yellow.</p>
            <h1> Schematic </h1>
            <p>
            <img src="fadecalc.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p> These are the calculations for the leds. I used a red, green, and yellow light and they all have 1.8V drop. I used this number to calculate the ohms for the resistor. I got 160 ohms, but the next best resistor is 220ohms.
            <br> I used a 10K resistor for the button because I do not want there to be a short and I need there to be some resistance for the current.</p>
            <p>
            <img src="fade_schematic.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p> This is the schematic of the breadboard and arduino. I used three different leds. </p>
            <h1> Code Snippet</h1>
            <p>
            <img src="fadesnippet.png" width=700></a>
            </p>
            <p> This is the code that is making the lights fade when the button is pressed. I commented each line. </p>
            <h1>Cicuit Operation</h1>
            <p>
            <img src="fadevid1.gif" width=600></a>
          </p>
            <p>This is the operation of the board. When the button is clicked three lights fade on and off in a row.</p>
