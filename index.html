            My name is Courtney McKee! I'm an HCDE major and excited to learn the following things in this class: how to create fun and interesting designs with a arduino.
            I want to focus on UX research when I graduate this year. Some things to know about me is that I love listening to music and going to concerts. I also enjoy cooking and baking all sorts of things.
