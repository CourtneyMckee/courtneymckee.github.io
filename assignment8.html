            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 8 which inlcudes the soldered circuit board and the schematic!!
            </p>
            <h1> Circuit </h1>

            <p> I soldered a red led with a 220 resistor. In order to make this I first put in the resistor and pushed down the sides so that it would stay in place. I then clipped the board and heated up the board and the metal on the resistor. This allowed the lead free solder to heat up and stick to the board. <br>
            I then put the red LED in and folded down the sides of the metal so that it would stay in place. I once again went through the process of soldering and clipping the board. When soldering I had to make sure that I wore glasses for safety.</p>
            <h1> Schematic</h1>

            </p>
            <p> This is the schematic of the board I made. I used a 220 resistor for the red led because that it closest resistor to 160.  </p>
